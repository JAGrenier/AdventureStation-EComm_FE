# 🧗‍♂️ Adventure Station  🚵🏼

With my background in outdoor recreation and interested in creating an e-commerence app, I was inspired to create an online store for buying outdoor experiences instead of items. The adventure station is an e-commerce site to register for outdoor adventures. The site include a home page, a product page, and a cart. The paypall developer sandbox api is set up to submit mock payments. 

## Build With
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap.
PayPal Developer Tools

## Features

## Challenges and Future Implementation 
Future plans for this project include creating an associated backend, an ability for users to login and save previous payment details, and the ability for admins to login in and create new adventures.
